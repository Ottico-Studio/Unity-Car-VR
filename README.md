VR Dealership Demo

Our immersive car dealership offers customers the opportunity to research, customize, and finalize their next car purchase all from the comfort of their homes, while simulating the atmosphere of a physical showroom.
Within this digital environment, potential buyers can engage with a live representative during designated business hours.
Upon entering, a real person warmly greets the customer and together they can explore featured vehicles from every angle in first person.
Throughout the experience, users can familiarize themselves with the car's advanced technology, have their questions answered regarding any specific features of the vehicle.

Initially, customers will have the opportunity to purchase featured vehicles and subsequently, this unparalleled experience will gradually expand to include the entire vehicle lineup. 

Down the road, our fully immersive tool allows customers to take a virtual test drive of a featured vehicle on La Pista 500, delivering an authentic driving experience in the Metaverse.
